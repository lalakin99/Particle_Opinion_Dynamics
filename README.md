# Particle and Opinion Dynamics 
## Network Dynamics and Learning Project 2

## üìú Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the second individual project in the "Network Dynamics and Learning" course at Politecnico di Torino (2023/2024). This project explores **random walk dynamics**, **opinion dynamics**, and the behavior of open and closed networks.

The main focus areas include:
1. Simulating a particle's movement in a network based on transition rates.
2. Studying French-DeGroot opinion dynamics and convergence to consensus.
3. Investigating particle dynamics in open and closed networks under proportional and fixed-rate assumptions.

## üîç Problem Breakdown

### **Problem 1: Single Particle Dynamics**
- **Objective**: Simulate the movement of a single particle in a closed network based on a given transition rate matrix and answer key questions:
  - Average return time to a node.
  - Hitting time between nodes.
  - Comparison of simulated and theoretical results.

### **Problem 2: Many Particle Dynamics**
- **Objective**: Simulate particle dynamics from two perspectives:
  - **Particle perspective**: Track individual particles.
  - **Node perspective**: Track the number of particles in each node over time.

### **Problem 3: Open Network Dynamics**
- **Objective**: Simulate particle flow in an open network under:
  - Proportional rates.
  - Fixed rates.
